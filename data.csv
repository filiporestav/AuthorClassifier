already would say many cases partly whole cases may really difficult one face even less hope success,Franz Kafka
list cases drawerhere would tap one drawers deskbut could unfortunately show k dealt official secrets,Franz Kafka
nonetheless great experience acquired cases would course benefit k course begun work straight away nearly ready submit first documents,Franz Kafka
applicant becomes insistent add come decision soon material brought together due regard course documents first documents submitted also checked,Franz Kafka
unfortunately even usually true first documents submitted usually mislaid lost completely even keep right end hardly read although lawyer knew rumour,Franz Kafka
result accused defence dont access even court records especially indictment means generally dont knowor least preciselywhat first documents need means contain anything relevance case lucky coincidence,Franz Kafka
anything individual charges reasons comes clearly guessed accused questioned possible work submit documents really direct issue present proof,Franz Kafka
effect course remove dignity whole procedure next time k court offices might like look lawyers room hes seen,Franz Kafka
light room comes little window high want look first get one colleagues support back even smoke chimney front go nose make face black,Franz Kafka
floor roomto give yet another example conditions therethere hole thats year big man could fall big enough foot disappear,Franz Kafka
lawyers room second floor attic foot go hang first floor attic underneath right corridor litigants waiting,Franz Kafka
accused doesnt get see court records either difficult infer whats court records whats said questioning based especially accused difficult situation faced every possible worry distract,Franz Kafka
counsel defence normally allowed present accused questioned afterwards possible still door interview room learn extract whatever might use even though accused report often confused,Franz Kafka
k likely already learned experience among lowest orders court organisation imperfections court strictly closed public staff forget duty take bribes extent show gaps,Franz Kafka
theres denying surprisingly favourable results attained accused way limited time petty advocates strut fro basis attract new clients course proceedings signifies either nothing nothing good,Franz Kafka
things real value honest personal contacts contacts higher officials albeit higher officials lower grades understand,Franz Kafka
necessary dr huld go court wait anterooms examining judges turn turn try achieve something according judges mood usually apparent real often even,Franz Kafka
k seen court officials including quite high come forward without asked glad give information fully open least easy understand discuss next stages proceedings fact cases quite willing adopt persons point view,Franz Kafka
however happens never trust far however firmly may declared new point view favour defendant might well go straight back offices write report court says opposite might well even harder defendant original view one insist theyve fully dissuaded,Franz Kafka
course theres way defending something said private indeed private cannot used public something makes easy defence keep gentlemens favour,Franz Kafka
hand also true gentlemen dont become involved defencewhich course done great expertisejust philanthropic reasons order friendly respects would truer say allocated,Franz Kafka
normal mediocre trials officials contact public theyre well equipped dont normal trials run course almost need nudge theyre faced cases especially difficult theyre lost often ones simple theyre forced spend time day night laws dont right feel human relationships thats serious shortcoming cases like,Franz Kafka
could seen many gentlemen window gentlemen would least expect staring window despair street lawyer desk studying documents give good advice,Franz Kafka
times like also possible see exceptionally seriously gentlemen take professions thrown great confusion difficulties natures overcome,Franz Kafka
different ranks hierarchies court endless even someone knows way around cannot always tell whats going happen,Franz Kafka
even junior officials proceedings courtrooms usually kept secret hardly able see cases work proceed court affairs appear range vision often without knowing come move without learning go,Franz Kafka
civil servants like able learn things learn studying successive stages individual trials go final verdict reasons,Franz Kafka
theyre allowed deal part trial law allocates usually know less results work left defence even though defence usually stay contact accused trial nearly end court officials learn many useful things defence,Franz Kafka
bearing mind still surprise k officials irritated often express litigants unflattering wayswhich experience shared everyone,Franz Kafka
goes like one older officials good peaceful man dealing difficult matter court become confused especially thanks contributions lawyers,Franz Kafka
nearly morning working twentyfour hours probably little result went front entrance waited ambush every time lawyer tried enter building would throw steps,Franz Kafka
lawyers gathered together front steps discussed one hand actually right allowed building hardly anything could legally official ive already mentioned would careful set officials,Franz Kafka
one lawyer another sent run steps let thrown offering resistance could long passive resistance colleagues would catch bottom steps,Franz Kafka
bottom steps could believe first sent somebody go look behind door see really noone gather together probably didnt even dare complain far lawyers job introduce improvements court system even want,Franz Kafka
even junior lawyer understand relationship extent one significant point almost every defendant even simple people begins think suggestions improving court soon proceedings begun many often even spend time energy matter could spent far better elsewhere,Franz Kafka
even possible improve detail itwhich anyway superstitious nonsensethe best could achieve although incalculable harm process attracted special attention officials case comes future officials always ready seek revenge,Franz Kafka
try gain insight size court organism extent remains state suspension even alter something one place youll draw ground feet might fall whereas enormous organism like court disrupted one place finds easy provide substitute somewhere else,Franz Kafka
everything connected everything else continue without change else quite probable even closed attentive strict malevolent,Franz Kafka
doesnt much good make accusations especially cant make clear theyre based full significance must said k caused great deal harm case behaviour towards office director influential man might well struck list might anything k trial mentioned even passing quite obvious hes ignoring,Franz Kafka
often something quite harmlessalthough ks behaviour could unfortunately called harmlesswill leave feeling offended even stop talking good friends turn away see everything oppose,Franz Kafka
particular reason surprisingly enough little joke ever attempted everything seemed hopeless make laugh theyll reconciled,Franz Kafka
hand also dark moments everyone think youve achieved nothing seems trials come good end determined good end start would without help others lost despite running fro effort little apparent successes gave joy,Franz Kafka
longer feel sure anything asked trial well nature turned worse assisted would even dare deny,Franz Kafka
lawyers especially vulnerable fits depression sortand fits depression coursewhen case suddenly taken hands theyve conducting satisfactorily time,Franz Kafka
client trial simply taken away lawyer even contact court officials wont help however good dont know anything,Franz Kafka
come home one day find documents youve submitted youve worked hard create best hopes lying desk theyve sent back cant carried next stage trial theyre worthless scraps paper,Franz Kafka
doesnt mean case lost least decisive reason supposing dont know anything case wont told anything whats happening,Franz Kafka
well cases like exceptions im glad say even ks trial one still time long way,Franz Kafka
said time submitting documents still future rush prepare much important start initial discussions appropriate officials already taken place,Franz Kafka
much better give away details time way k could influenced unfavourably hopes might raised might made anxious better say individuals spoken favourably shown willing help although others spoken less favourably even way refused help,Franz Kafka
results encouraging certainly draw particular conclusions preliminary proceedings begin way way developed would show value preliminary proceedings,Franz Kafka
anyway nothing lost yet succeed getting office director despite everything sideand several actions undertaken endthen everything clean wound surgeon would say wait results comfort,Franz Kafka
first set documents submitted worked still ready usually turned great advantage next time k went see earlier occasion would bad time put could known,Franz Kafka
k stupefied talking ever pointed even considering difficulties progress slow lawyer would object progress slow might progressed far k come right time,Franz Kafka
would stand behind kpretending watch lawyer bent greedily cup poured tea drankand secretly let k hold hand,Franz Kafka
wanted take dishes away said leni would give others hands final squeeze lawyer would wipe mouth start talking k renewed energy,Franz Kafka
maybe everything lawyer said quite right even though obviously wanted make conspicuous possible probably never even taken case important said ks,Franz Kafka
lawyer never forgot mention dealing junior officials meant officials dependent others direction taken trial could important furtherment,Franz Kafka
certainly mean would every trial likely probably also trials gave lawyer advantages room needed turn direction wanted would also advantage keep reputation intact,Franz Kafka
really relationship would direct ks trial lawyer explained especially difficult therefore important enough attract great attention first time came court,Franz Kafka
first signs could already seen fact first documents still submitted even though trial already lasted several months according lawyer everything still initial stages effective course making defendant passive keeping helpless,Franz Kafka
alone world would easy ignore although also certain case trial would never arisen first place,Franz Kafka
uncle already dragged see lawyer take account family job longer totally separate progress trial carelesslywith certain inexplicable complacencymentioned acquaintances others learned ways know relationship miss brstner seemed trouble,Franz Kafka
capable working high position bank relatively short time retain respect everyone simply apply talents made possible trial doubt turn well,Franz Kafka
trial nothing big piece business like already concluded benefit bank many times piece business concealed many lurking dangers waiting ambush usually dangers would need defended,Franz Kafka
lawyer told talked something unheard would probably great deal harm k could tolerate impediment efforts trial concerned impediments probably caused lawyer,Franz Kafka
shaken lawyer documents would need submitted straight away possible would need see dealt every day,Franz Kafka
day day one women somebody else behalf would run officials force sit desks study ks documents instead looking corridor grating,Franz Kafka
could letup efforts everything would need organised supervised time court came defendant knew defend make use rights,Franz Kafka
earlier week could felt shame thought made write documents never entered head task could also difficult,Franz Kafka

left defence lawyer trial little basic affect observed afar something scarcely able reach directly suited looked see things stood also able draw head back whenever wanted,Franz Kafka
contrast conduct defence would devote entirely courtfor time leastsuccess would mean later complete conclusive liberation achieve would place start far greater danger far,Franz Kafka
carefully worked defenceand sort would made sensedid carefully worked defence also mean would need shut everything else much could,Franz Kafka
involved much submitting documents could probably prepare days leave although would great temerity ask time bank time whole trial way seeing long might last,Franz Kafka
hoped rumours reached far deputy director otherwise would obviously soon find way making use harm k would show neither comradeship humaneness,Franz Kafka
true well disposed towards k soon heard trial would probably try everything could make easier would certainly devote,Franz Kafka
k one time provided counterbalance deputy director said director coming influence deputy director would also exploit weakened condition director strengthen power,Franz Kafka
maybe considerations sort weakened power resistance still necessary deceive oneself see everything clearly could seen moment,Franz Kafka
horrible autumn said manufacturer come room unnoticed seeing deputy director stood behind k k nodded looked uneasily manufacturers briefcase would probably take papers inform k result negotiations deputy director,Franz Kafka
however manufacturer saw k looking knocked briefcase without opening said youll wanting hear things turned,Franz Kafka
k unconsciously made step towards door wanting show manufacturer manufacturer said chief clerk theres something else id like mention,Franz Kafka

one time visits became bit frequent began tell started talking became interested could earn living painting learned amazement main source income painting portraits,Franz Kafka
ever since learn something new court every time comes visit little little get understand something works,Franz Kafka
anyway titorelli talks lot often push away hes bound lying also businessman like whos already close breaking point weight business worries cant pay much attention peoples,Franz Kafka
perhapsthis ive thinkingperhaps titorelli might able help small way knows lots judges even cant much influence give advice get influential people side,Franz Kafka
even best advantage might derive recommendation incomparably smaller damage lay fact manufacturer knowing trial painter spreading news,Franz Kafka
ill go said took leave manufacturer door im busy present ill write perhaps would like come office time,Franz Kafka
despite seeming calm outside actually shocked told manufacturer would write titorelli show way valued recommendations would consider opportunity speak titorelli without delay thought titorelli could offer worthwhile assistance would delayed,Franz Kafka
possible might invite questionable character bank clear letter ask advice trial separated deputy director door possible even likely also dangers failed see even running towards,Franz Kafka
mr k one saying k told servitor fetch winter coat said three servitor helped put please forgive gentlemen im afraid time see present,Franz Kafka
weve already come understanding said k gentlemen could held back longer surrounded k explained would waiting hours something important discussed length private,Franz Kafka
deputy director listened short also looked k held hat hand cleaning dust said gentlemen simple way solve,Franz Kafka
would probably much better take winter coat least try win back two gentlemen certainly still waiting next room,Franz Kafka

k made step forward deputy director said thank ive already found big package papers certainly must included many documents copy contract turned went back office,Franz Kafka
cant deal right k said personal difficulties settled hell certainly first get effect certainly wont like,Franz Kafka
slightly calmed thoughts k gave servitor already long holding door corridor open task telling director able k going bank business matter,Franz Kafka
went straight painter lived outlying part town near court offices although area even poorer houses darker streets full dirt slowly blew halfmelted snow,Franz Kafka
great gateway building painter lived one two doors open hole broken open wall door k approached repulsive yellow steaming liquid shot causing rats scurry away nearby canal,Franz Kafka
staircase small child lying belly crying could hardly heard noise metalworkshop side entrance hall drowning sound,Franz Kafka
large tin plate hung wall casting pale light pushed way two workers lighting faces workaprons,Franz Kafka
k glance things wanted get things soon possible exchange words find things stood painter go straight back bank,Franz Kafka
third floor slow pace quite breaththe steps like height floor much higher needed hed told painter lived right attic,Franz Kafka
k followed slowly caught one girls stumbled left behind others asked went side side painter titorelli lives,Franz Kafka
asked opening mouth wide lightly hitting k hand said something extraordinarily surprising clumsy hands lifted skirt already short fast could ran girls whose indistinct shouts lost heights,Franz Kafka
thanks k found right direction without delayhe would continued stairs straight front showed reach titorelli would need turn one side,Franz Kafka
steps led painter especially narrow long without turning whole length could seen one glance top titorellis closed door came end,Franz Kafka
door much better illuminated rest stairway light small skylight set obliquely put together unpainted planks wood name titorelli painted broad red brushstrokes,Franz Kafka
k half way steps accompanied retinue girls clearly result noise footsteps door opened slightly crack man seemed dressed nightshirt appeared,Franz Kafka
still arrived top however painter suddenly pulled door wide open deep bow invited k enter,Franz Kafka
girls hand tried keep away want let however much begged however much tried get inif could get permission would try force way,Franz Kafka
one succeed hunchback slipped outstretched arm painter chased grabbed skirt span round set door girls unlike first dared cross doorstep painter left post,Franz Kafka
one behind girls door stretched necks high called various words painter meant jest k understand even painter laughed hunchback whirled round hand,Franz Kafka
also barefooted apart wearing nothing loose pair yellowish linen trousers held belt whose free end whipped fro,Franz Kafka
suppose come back home lady im going paint open door key find hunchback something table painting lips red paintbrush meanwhile little sisters keeping guard moving causing chaos every corner room,Franz Kafka
else like happened yesterday might come back home late eveningplease forgive appearance room mess themso might come home late evening want go bed feel something pinching leg look bed pull another,Franz Kafka
meanwhile k looking round room pointed would never occurred wretched little room could called studio,Franz Kafka
manufacturer said clearly titorelli acquaintance poor man dependent charity would really quite possible believe titorelli know least could remember,Franz Kafka
whats remarkably similar picture lawyers office although one showed quite different judge heavy man full beard black bushy extended sides far mans cheeks,Franz Kafka
thatll need work done painter told taking pastel crayon small table added strokes edges figure without making clearer far k could make,Franz Kafka
pity cant make details costume pose picture pastel colours arent really suitable showing people like,Franz Kafka
sight picture seemed make feel like working rolled shirtsleeves picked crayons k watched reddish shadow built around head judge quivering tips radiated edges picture,Franz Kafka
around figure justice apart coloration barely noticeable remained light brightness figure seemed shine forward looked like neither god justice god victory seemed rather perfect depiction god hunt,Franz Kafka
k found painters work engrossing wanted finally reproached staying long without done anything relevant affair,Franz Kafka
k forewent opportunity excuse way wish distract painter saying else perhaps didnt want get far way make extent unattainable asked publicly acknowledged position,Franz Kafka
talking case manufacturer yesterday asked wouldnt like help answered come see likes im pleased see soon,Franz Kafka
air room slowly become quite oppressive several times looked amazement small iron stove corner certainly could lit heat room inexplicable,Franz Kafka
k made reply actually heat made uncomfortable much stuffiness air almost made difficult breathe room probably ventilated long time,Franz Kafka
painter even seemed misunderstand k remained edge bed urged k make comfortable hesitated went bed pressed k deep bedclothes pillows,Franz Kafka
yes said k felt simple joy answering question especially answer given private individual therefore would consequences,Franz Kafka
k wanted find said therefore im sure youre familiar court know hardly ive heard thats many different people,Franz Kafka
agreed one thing ill thoughtout accusations made ignored court made accusation convinced guilt defendant hard make think otherwise,Franz Kafka
painter leapt door opened slightlythe girls clasped hands could seen stretching crack wanted somethingand said youre quiet ill throw stairs,Franz Kafka
im sorry said painter returned k k hardly turned towards door left completely painter whether would place protection wanted,Franz Kafka
even made hardly movement painter bent whispering ear order heard outside said girls belong court well,Franz Kafka
something never noticed said k curtly general comment painters made comment girls far less disturbing,Franz Kafka
still dont seem much general idea courts said painter stretched legs wide apart tapping loudly floor tip foot,Franz Kafka
really easy influence judges personal contacts lawyer said painters contacts vain judges especially important least undervalued,Franz Kafka
painter observed effect explanation k certain unease said occur way im speaking almost like lawyer,Franz Kafka
cant use new people rules governing various grades officials painted many varied secret noone outside certain families even knows,Franz Kafka
sometimes seemed painter using comments make favourable outcome trial precondition help course would make help unnecessary,Franz Kafka
nonetheless continued unabashed said remarked earlier court cannot approached reasoned proofs later restricted open court go far say innocent man needs assistance court,Franz Kafka
ive never seen writing law course say one hand innocent set free hand doesnt say judges influenced,Franz Kafka
boy used listen closely father told us court cases home judges came studio talked court circles nobody talks anything else hardly ever got chance go court always made use could ive listened countless trials important stages development ive followed closely far could followed say ive never seen single acquittal,Franz Kafka
theres point talking said k wanted time accept anything painter told even thought unlikely contradicted told others,Franz Kafka
time examine truth everything painter said even disprove would achieved much could painter would help way even help would decisive,Franz Kafka
oh said painter defence window cant opened room retains heat better window double glazed even though single pane,Franz Kafka
theres much need air room theres much ventilation gaps wood want open one doors even,Franz Kafka
instance judge im painting present comes always comes door bed ive even given key door wait studio im home,Franz Kafka
time painter speaking k considering whether take coat finally realised didnt would quite unable stay longer took frock coat lay knee could put back soon conversation,Franz Kafka
get either help itll take effort course difference apparent acquittal needs concentrated effort deferment takes much less effort sustained,Franz Kafka
least happens matter half way especially id teach advance exactly youd need act judge concerned course,Franz Kafka
ill certainly make several attempts still well forget least afford one judge pass decisive verdict,Franz Kafka
document asserting defendants innocence guaranteed number judges judge acquit without worries although still several formalities gone theres doubt thats hell favour several acquaintances,Franz Kafka
thats right said painter apparently free put better way temporarily free junior judges ones know dont right give final acquittal,Franz Kafka
thats say theyre freed way time charge withdrawn still hanging heads takes order higher bring back force,Franz Kafka
im good contact court also tell difference absolute apparent acquittal described superficial way directives court offices,Franz Kafka
theres absolute acquittal proceedings stop everything disappears process indictment trial even acquittal disappears everything disappears,Franz Kafka
apart proceedings go court offices continue business case gets passed higher courts gets passed back lower courts backwards forwards sometimes faster sometimes slower fro,Franz Kafka
one daynoone expects itsome judge picks documents looks closely notices particular case still active orders defendants immediate arrest,Franz Kafka
ive talking theres long delay apparent acquittal rearrest quite possible know cases like likely defendant goes home hes acquitted finds somebody waiting rearrest,Franz Kafka
countless reasons judges mood legal acumen case altered efforts obtain second acquittal must therefore suited new conditions generally vigorous first,Franz Kafka
clearly dont think apparent acquittal offers much advantage said painter perhaps deferment would suit better,Franz Kafka
deferment said painter looking vaguely front trying find perfectly appropriate explanation deferment consists keeping proceedings permanently earliest stages,Franz Kafka
must never let trial sight go see appropriate judge regular intervals well something particular comes whatever try remain friendly dont know judge personally influence judges know without giving direct discussions,Franz Kafka
compared apparent acquittal deferment advantage defendants future less uncertain hes safe shock suddenly rearrested doesnt need fear exertions stress involved getting apparent acquittal everything else life would make difficult,Franz Kafka
show interrogations instance theyre short ever dont time dont feel like going offer excuse judges even arrange injunctions together long time advance essence means accused report judge time time,Franz Kafka
ill come back soon said k suddenly decided put frock coat threw overcoat shoulder hurried door behind girls began scream,Franz Kafka
instead opening door painter crawled bed underneath asked k moment would like see picture could sell,Franz Kafka
k want impolite painter really taken side promised help future ks forgetfulness mention payment painters help k could turn allowed show picture even though quivering impatience get studio,Franz Kafka
covered dust painter tried blow one top dust swirled around front ks eyes robbing breath time,Franz Kafka
moorland landscape said painter passing picture k showed two sickly trees well separated dark grass,Franz Kafka
seem like subject said painter picking third painting good job ive still got another similar picture,Franz Kafka
even without invitation k shown compunction already placing foot middle bed covers looked open door drew foot back,Franz Kafka
seemed one basic rules governing defendant behave always prepared never allow surprises never look unsuspecting right judge stood beside leftand basic rule continually violating,Franz Kafka
man half sitting half laying face buried arm bench seemed sleeping another man standing halfdark end corridor,Franz Kafka
soon came across servant courtk able recognise servants court gold buttons wore civilian clothes normal buttonsand painter instructed go k carrying pictures,Franz Kafka
pictures taken office locked lowest drawer desk could least keep safe deputy directors view next days,Franz Kafka
decision day intended go see lawyer took lot strength needed work worked exceptionally slowly remain office long time already past ten oclock finally stood front lawyers front door,Franz Kafka
even rang considered whether might better give lawyer notice letter telephone personal conversation would certainly difficult,Franz Kafka
nonetheless k actually want without gave notice means would received silence formulated words unless leni could discover anything k would never learn lawyer taken dismissal consequences might lawyers unimportant opinion,Franz Kafka
sitting front taken surprise dismissal k would able easily infer everything wanted lawyers face behaviour even could induced say much,Franz Kafka
leni could bit quicker thought k could least glad nobody else interfering usually happened man nightshirt anyone else might bother,Franz Kafka
thought might reason keep name secret said k felt much liberty normally felt foreign parts speaking people lower standing keeping everything speaking casually interests able raise level ones also able let drop,Franz Kafka
asked businessman moved forwards towards door propelled hands k outside corridor k said know lenis hidden,Franz Kafka
stove alone three times bigger normal stoves possible see detail beyond kitchen time illuminated small lamp hanging entrance,Franz Kafka
leni put one hand around k stirred soup drew forward toward said hes pitiful character poor businessman name block,Franz Kafka
businessman sitting chair k directed extinguished candle whose light longer needed pressed wick fingers stop smoke,Franz Kafka
leni laughed loud k paying attention took opportunity embracing whispering leave alone see sort person,Franz Kafka
tell im first said k bad mood originally intended detailed discussion business leni especially question giving lawyer notice longer wanted presence businessman,Franz Kafka
considered affair important let little businessman take part perhaps change decisions called leni back even though already way lawyer,Franz Kafka
ive got say keep awake said k still wanted intimate intended important negotiations lawyer wanted leni ask ask advice,Franz Kafka
went dish deliberately brushed whispered ill tell youre soon hes eaten soup get back soon possible,Franz Kafka
k watched went decision finally made lawyer dismissed probably better able discuss matter leni beforehand hardly understood complexity matter would certainly advised perhaps would even prevented dismissing lawyer time would remained doubt unease eventually carried decision anyway decision something could avoid,Franz Kafka
asked k dont know mean said businessman hes business lawyeri buy sell cerealshes business lawyer since took business thats twenty years perhaps mean trial hes representing since started thats five years,Franz Kafka
yes well five years added pulling old briefcase ive got everything written tell exact dates like,Franz Kafka
combination criminal commercial business seemed surprisingly reassuring k oh yes said businessman whispered even say hes efficient jurisprudence matters,Franz Kafka
im sure wont anything faithful client said k oh might said businessman gets cross doesnt matter anyway im really faithful,Franz Kafka
think itll alright said k well said businessman ill tell youll tell secret support lawyer,Franz Kafka
means mustnt neglect anything might use even theres little hope particular thing use cant throw away,Franz Kafka
ive taken money business example offices business used occupy nearly whole floor need little room back work one apprentice,Franz Kafka
dont forget proceedings like always lots different things coming talk things cant understand reason alone get tired distracted things instead people rely superstition,Franz Kafka
theres nothing achieved forming group sometimes individual achieve something secret thats done others learn nobody knows done,Franz Kafka
said k slow businessman speaking fast laid hand businessmans reassure id like ask speak little slowly many important things cant follow exactly youre saying,Franz Kafka
one hand want come back soon still many questions ask want find intimate discussion businessman hand irritated stayed long lawyer k much longer needed give soup,Franz Kafka
ill find everything thought k nodding vigorously could thereby encourage businessman say everything worth knowing,Franz Kafka
case businessman continued didnt move hearings took place went every one collected materials handed business books courtwhich later found entirely unnecessaryi ran back forth lawyer submitted various documents court various documents,Franz Kafka
lots good reasons first documents still arent ready said businessman anyway turned later ones submitted entirely worthless,Franz Kafka
lots latin cant understand pages pages general appeals court lots flattery particular officials werent named officials anyone familiar court must able guess selfpraise lawyer humiliated court way downright doglike endless investigations cases past supposed similar mine,Franz Kafka
dont mean criticise lawyers work document read one many even something say time couldnt see progress trial,Franz Kafka
im businessman much days wanted see tangible progress moving conclusion least moving way according rules,Franz Kafka
instead hearings went things anyway answers pat like church service messengers court coming work several times week came home anywhere else could find disturbing course least things better respect much less disturbing contact telephone rumours trial even started spread among people business especially relations made suffer many different ways still slightest sign even first hearing would take place soon,Franz Kafka
explained length refused anything asked noone influence way trial proceeds said try insist documents submittedlike askingwas simply unheard would harm,Franz Kafka
say anything none asked definite date main trial none got one anyway apart one exception ill talk minute really impossible thats one thing lawyer didnt mislead besides reason regret turning lawyers,Franz Kafka
perhaps youve already heard dr huld talks petty lawyers probably made sound contemptible hes right contemptible,Franz Kafka
one colleagues minor lawyers difference rank great lawyers ive ever heard never seen incomparably greater minor lawyers despised petty lawyers,Franz Kafka
anyway best think makes discussions lawyers advice manage achieve seem unpleasant useless experience wanted throw everything away lay home bed hear nothing,Franz Kafka
asked k long said businessman smiled cant forget entirely im afraid especially night thoughts come easily,Franz Kafka
indeed sat close together either turned head even slightly would knocked others businessman small also sat hunched k also forced bend low wanted hear everything,Franz Kafka
watched irritation leni took candle businessmans handwhich holding timewiped hand apron knelt beside scratch wax dripped candle onto trousers,Franz Kafka
maybe doesnt want speak front leni thought k suppressing impatience hear rest straight away stopped trying press,Franz Kafka
asked businessman wanting hear answer wanting leni speak businessman werent full secret resentment towards leni today,Franz Kafka
exclaimed k thought businessman would wait quickly settled business lawyer would leave together discuss everything thoroughly undisturbed,Franz Kafka
latter nodded although spoken quite openly k earlier seemed confused shame said yes later become dependent lawyer,Franz Kafka
head bed niche wall fastidiously tidy stood candle bottle ink pen bundle papers probably trial,Franz Kafka
k looked long first impression businessman perhaps right experience trial already lasted long time paid heavy price experience,Franz Kafka
im sure must noticed importunate sometimes said patted ks hand k rested bedside table snatched back,Franz Kafka
anyway perhaps least explain peculiarity seem rather disturbed way youre looking thats ill peculiarity consists leni finds accused attractive,Franz Kafka
cannot guilt makes attractive guiltyat least thats lawyer sayand proper punishment made attractive punished proceedings levelled take kind hold,Franz Kafka
lawyer finished saying k fully control even nodded conspicuously last words order confirm view already formed lawyer trying confuse always making general irrelevant observations thus distract main question actually ks trial,Franz Kafka
lawyer must noticed k offering resistance became silent giving k chance speak k also remained silent asked particular reason coming see today,Franz Kafka
yes said k putting hand slightly shade eyes light candle could see lawyer better wanted tell im withdrawing representation immediate effect,Franz Kafka
used word intention letting k go free even could longer represent could still least continue adviser,Franz Kafka
nothing rushed said k standing slowly going behind chair everything well thought probably even long,Franz Kafka
circumstances important enough said lawyer wrapped bed cover around top half body blanket around legs,Franz Kafka
unwelcome k hear old man speak touching way forced explain fully would rather avoided aware also confused even though could never make reverse decision,Franz Kafka
thank feeling friendly toward said also realise deeply involved youve case deeply possible bring much advantage possible,Franz Kafka
would naturally never attempt considering much older experienced convince opinion ever unintentionally done beg forgiveness said circumstances important enough belief trial needs approached much vigour far case,Franz Kafka
first came uncle probably noticed wasnt greatly concerned case wasnt reminded force would forget completely,Franz Kafka
never anything case hardly aware someone representing everything set something happen always without cease waiting something getting tense nothing,Franz Kafka
get information court probably could got anywhere else cant enough trial supposedly secret getting closer closer,Franz Kafka
wasnt trying show mistaken said lawyer wanted add expected better judgement others especially ive given insight workings court activities normally,Franz Kafka
something personal uncles sake really see ks case one exceptional hoped able distinguish either ks sake orand possibility could never excludedfor friends court,Franz Kafka
partly changes way business concentrate nowadays matters case partly ever deeper understanding acquire legal matters,Franz Kafka
found could never let anyone else deal sort work unless wanted harm client job taken,Franz Kafka
decision work obvious result forced turn almost everyone away asked represent could accept especially interested inwell enough creatures leap every crumb throw theyre far away,Franz Kafka
despite dont regret decision quite possibly turned cases away turn entirely necessary devote fully cases take successful results showed worth,Franz Kafka
said lawyers lead clients thread judgement passed others immediately lift clients onto shoulders carry way judgement beyond,Franz Kafka
way lawyer speaking k thought could hear could expect gave delays excuses would begin reports documents progressing mood court officials improved well enormous difficultiesin short heard many times would brought even fully would try mislead k hopes never specified make suffer threats never clear,Franz Kafka
see impression misjudged legal assistance given also misjudgement led behave way seem although accused treated well put better way handled neglect apparent neglect,Franz Kafka
looked hurriedly k lawyer try find happened seemed reassured sight k sitting calmly lawyers bed,Franz Kafka
block noticed least noone chasing away tiptoe entered room face tense hands clenched behind back,Franz Kafka
block already crept way room question seemed give first shove breast another back seemed fall remained standing deeply bowed said service sir,Franz Kafka
lawyer started speaking block stopped looking bed stared rather one corners listening light speaker brighter block could bear look,Franz Kafka
block still sense pride least k concerned went towards waving fists shouting loudly dared lawyer,Franz Kafka
think allowed sit quietly listen creep fours put makes something better theres old legal saying ought bear mind youre suspicion better moving still youre still pan scales without knowing weighed along sins,Franz Kafka
could see lawyer deliberately humiliating purpose today show power k perhaps even thereby subjugate k,Franz Kafka
block incapable seeing feared lawyer insight would even use either sly bold lie lawyer conceal fact lawyers working behalf,Franz Kafka
dared even went lawyers bed began make complaints k dr huld sir said hear way man spoke,Franz Kafka
doesnt know anything insults far weak ability allows ive made close study behave court ought court practices,Franz Kafka
leni leant lawyer stretched attractive shape body could seen bent close face stroked long white hair,Franz Kafka
im rather wary telling said lawyer head could seen shaking slightly perhaps would feel pressure lenis hand better,Franz Kafka
k feeling listening contrived dialogue repeated many times would repeated many times block alone would never lose freshness,Franz Kafka
lawyers methods k fortunately exposed long let client forget whole world leave nothing hope reaching end trial deluded means,Franz Kafka
k listened testing thinking given task closely observing everything spoken inform higher office write report,Franz Kafka
think hed say learned trial still hasnt begun told havent even rung bell announce start proceedings,Franz Kafka
alright block alright said lawyer words block begun raise trembling knees clearly wanted plead explanation,Franz Kafka
embarrassed block ran fingers pile carpet anxiety judge said let forget inferior status towards lawyer thought turned judges words round examine sides,Franz Kafka
chapter left unfinished chapter nine cathedral important italian business contact bank come visit city first time k given task showing cultural sights,Franz Kafka
every hour could office cause concern longer able make use time office anything like well previously spent many hours merely pretending important work increased anxiety office,Franz Kafka
sometimes thought saw deputy director always watching come ks office sit desk look papers receive clients almost become old friends k lure away perhaps even discovered mistakes mistakes seemed threaten k thousand directions work could longer avoid,Franz Kafka
ever asked leave office business even needed make short business trip however much honour seemedand tasks sort happened increased substantially recentlythere always suspicion wanted get office check work least idea thought dispensable,Franz Kafka
reason never demurred accepting even asked go tiring business trip lasting two days said nothing go rainy autumn weather severe chill order avoid risk asked go,Franz Kafka
temptation turn job great especially direct connection business denying social obligations towards business contact important enough k knew quite well needed successes work maintain position failed would help even italian somehow found quite charming want removed workplace even one day fear allowed back great knew full well fear exaggerated still made anxious,Franz Kafka
however case almost impossible think acceptable excuse knowledge italian great still good enough deciding factor k earlier known little art history become widely known around bank extremely exaggerated form k member society preservation city monuments albeit business reasons,Franz Kafka
rainy stormy morning k foul temper thought day ahead arrived early seven oclock office could least work visitor would prevent,Franz Kafka

whatever cause k realised possibility communicating italian largely taken even french difficult understand moustache concealed movements lips might offered help understanding said,Franz Kafka
k began anticipate many difficulties gave trying understand italian saidwith director could understand easily would pointless effortand time scowl italian relaxed sitting deep comfortable armchair frequently pulled short sharply tailored jacket one time lifted arms air moved hands freely try depict something k could grasp even though leaning forward let hands sight,Franz Kafka
k nothing occupy mechanically watch exchange two men tiredness finally made felt alarm although fortunately good time caught nearly getting turning round leaving,Franz Kafka
director doubt seen anxiety ks eyes tried cope dialect italian joined conversation way adroit unobtrusive seemed adding minor comments whereas fact swiftly patiently breaking italian said k could understand,Franz Kafka
k learned way italian first business matters settle unfortunately little time disposal certainly intend rush round see every monument city would much ratherat least long k would agree entirely decisionjust see cathedral thoroughly,Franz Kafka
extremely pleased accompanied someone learned pleasantby meant k occupied listening italian directorand asked would kind time suitable meet cathedral two hours time ten oclock,Franz Kafka

outside pulpits balustrade covered green foliage continued column supporting little angels could seen among leaves lively still,Franz Kafka
k walked pulpit examined sides stonework sculpted great care seemed foliage trapped deep darkness behind leaves held prisoner k lay hand one gaps cautiously felt stone totally unaware pulpits existence,Franz Kafka
k happened notice one church staff standing behind next row pews wore loose creased black cassock held snuff box left hand watching k want,Franz Kafka
man cassock saw k noticed raised right hand pinch snuff still held two fingers pointed vague direction,Franz Kafka

patience puts mans requests years little questioning sessions accepting gifts politeness puts man cursing fate even though doorkeeper caused fateall things seem want arouse sympathy,Franz Kafka
many commentators go even explaining way think words youre insatiable expression friendly admiration albeit condescension,Franz Kafka
yes hes afraid man man wants nothing go inside law even hes heard terrible doormen contrast doorkeeper doesnt want go least dont hear anything,Franz Kafka
countered supposing could given job doorkeeper somebody calling inside cant gone far inside couldnt bear sight third doorkeeper,Franz Kafka
